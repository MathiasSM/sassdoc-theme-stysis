# [SassDoc Theme: Stysis](https://github.com/MathiasSM/sassdoc-theme-stysis)

> Not suited for production yet. Use at your own risk.

This theme uses [Themeleon](https://github.com/themeleon/themeleon) as a theme engine, and [themeleon-swig](https://github.com/themeleon/themeleon-swig) as a template engine, directly plugged into Themeleon.

+ **Note:** Swig is no longer maintained. Next major version (1.0.0) will _not_ use Swig templates, but another templating engine (Haml, perhaps?).
